ultrathink I would like to set up a configuration that will successfully develop on this project.

Please do a thorough review of the articles listed on this website which is the latest research on claude code and how to get the most out of it.

https://www.anthropic.com/engineering

Also do a thorough review of the documenatation:

https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview

This github repo also looks interesting, review and and see how it compliments and contrasts with the guidance from Anthropic:

https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin

Also search claude code marketplaces for helpful plugins. Learn about the concept here:

https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces

This website is a good starting place to look for them:

https://claudemarketplaces.com/

Also search the web thoroughly for other options.

This is a helpful reference that is speicifc to this project. It is about MCP for Looker and BigQueyr:

https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/getting-started/introduction/

This is the github repo:

https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox

Fore more context on this project, review the history of development on the gitlab repo:

https://gitlab.com/wendys/analytics/data_factory

At this point I have not decided what I want the final output to be.

The first checkpoint I want you to create is a range of proposals on how I might configure this environment to successfully develop on this project with claude code doing as much of the work as possible.

Quality > speed. Take your time. Go deep.

Learn from examples as much as possible. Theoretical ways of doing this are less relevant than reported practical success.

Be skeptical of people who claim success without proof. Social proof is also relevant.
a
For example, Articles published by Anthropic and on Claude websites should carry much more weight than blogs run by individuals.

Before you start, repeat this back to me and ask any clarifying questions. Don't rush to start, let's set this up for success by doing plenty of up front work.
