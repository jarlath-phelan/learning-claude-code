# Financial Basics Explainer - AI Video Prompts

## For InVideo AI / Revid.ai

### Main Prompt:
Create a 60-second TikTok-style vertical video explaining basic financial concepts for beginners.

Style: Approachable, slightly humorous, uses relatable analogies
Tone: Like a smart friend explaining money stuff at a coffee shop
Format: 9:16 vertical, bold text overlays, clean animations

Script to follow:
"Nobody taught you this in school, so let me break it down.

The 50/30/20 rule. 50% of your income goes to NEEDS - rent, food, bills. 30% goes to WANTS - Netflix, coffee, that thing you'll use twice. 20% goes to SAVINGS. Non-negotiable.

Emergency fund. You need 3-6 months of expenses saved. Why? Because life WILL punch you in the face. Car breaks down. You get laid off. Medical bill. This money is your shield.

Compound interest is either your best friend or worst enemy. Put $200 a month into an index fund starting at 25? You'll have over a MILLION by retirement. Start at 35? Half that. Time is the cheat code.

Credit cards aren't free money. That 24% APR means a $1000 purchase becomes $1240 if you only pay minimums for a year. Pay it off. Every. Single. Month.

Your 401k match is FREE MONEY. If your employer matches 4%, contribute at LEAST 4%. Otherwise you're literally saying no to free cash.

Start today. Not tomorrow. Today."

Visual requirements:
- Pie chart for 50/30/20 split
- Money/coins animations
- Growth chart for compound interest
- Credit card with warning signs
- Clean, professional but not boring aesthetic
- Green for good financial moves, red for warnings
