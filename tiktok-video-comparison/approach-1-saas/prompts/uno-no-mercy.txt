# UNO No Mercy Explainer - AI Video Prompts

## For InVideo AI / Revid.ai

### Main Prompt:
Create a 60-75 second TikTok-style vertical video explaining UNO No Mercy card game rules.

Style: Fast-paced, energetic, Gen-Z humor, dramatic reveals
Tone: Playful but slightly menacing, like explaining a horror movie plot
Format: 9:16 vertical, bold text overlays, quick cuts

Script to follow:
"So you think you know UNO? Nah. Let me tell you about NO MERCY.

168 cards. SIX players max. And if you get 25 cards in your hand? You're DEAD. Eliminated. Gone. That's the Mercy Rule and there IS no mercy.

Plus 2? That's cute. Plus 4? Getting warmer. PLUS 10. And guess what? You can STACK them. Someone hits you with a plus 4? Throw down a plus 6. Now THEY draw 10.

But here's what NO ONE tells you. That plus 4? It's NOT a wild card anymore. It has a COLOR. Red plus 4 only plays on RED.

Play a 7, you SWAP your entire hand with someone. Play a 0, EVERYONE passes their hand. Skip Everyone? You skip THE WHOLE TABLE.

And if you can't play? You draw until you CAN play. No stopping. Just pain.

This game has ended friendships. Who wants to play?"

Visual requirements:
- Show UNO cards flying/stacking
- Text overlays for key numbers (168, 25, +10)
- Dramatic zoom on reveals
- Screen shake on impactful moments
- Dark/dramatic background with UNO colors (red, blue, green, yellow)
