## Optimization Tips:

1. **First 3 seconds are everything** - Lead with controversy, question, or shock
2. **Use numbers** - "5 things" performs better than "some things"
3. **Pattern interrupt** - Change visuals every 3-5 seconds
4. **Text on screen** - 80% of TikTok is watched on mute
5. **End with engagement** - Question, challenge, or cliffhanger
