So you think you know UNO? Nah. Let me tell you about NO MERCY.

168 cards. SIX players max. And if you get 25 cards in your hand? You're DEAD. Eliminated. Gone. That's the Mercy Rule and there IS no mercy.

Plus 2? That's cute. Plus 4? Getting warmer. PLUS 10. And guess what? You can STACK them. Someone hits you with a plus 4? Throw down a plus 6. Now THEY draw 10. Unless they stack higher. It keeps going until someone CAN'T match it and draws EVERYTHING.

But here's what NO ONE tells you. That plus 4? It's NOT a wild card anymore. It has a COLOR. Red plus 4 only plays on RED. The wilds are Draw 6, Draw 10, Reverse Draw 4, and Color Roulette. THOSE play anytime.

Oh you thought we were done? Play a 7, you SWAP your entire hand with someone. Play a 0, EVERYONE passes their hand to the next person. Skip Everyone? You skip THE WHOLE TABLE and go again. Discard All? Dump every card of that color at once. Color Roulette? They flip cards until they hit the color they call. Could be 2 cards. Could be 15.

And if you can't play? You don't just draw one card like a NORMAL person. You draw until you CAN play. No stopping. No passing. Just pain.

This game has ended friendships. Ruined holidays. Created villains. Anyway, who wants to play?
